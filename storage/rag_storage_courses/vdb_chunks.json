We’ve moved from predictive models that analyze patterns to generative AI that creates new content. Now, we’re entering the next phase: agentic AI— systems that don’t just generate, but have the agency to act, adapt, and collaborate, in real time. \n\nFor AI agents to be useful, they need more than just intelligence. They need infrastructure. They need security. They need governance. \n\nAn agent must consume data, use tools, make decisions, and share outputs across an organization. But rigid, request-driven architectures can’t keep up. APIs and synchronous workflows create bottlenecks, limit scalability, and make coordination between multiple agents a nightmare. The future of AI agents isn’t about making models better, it’s about making AI systems work together seamlessly. \n\nThis demands an event-driven architecture (EDA) powered by a data streaming platform, which enables agents to react dynamically to changes, share state efficiently, and scale without the constraints of traditional request-response patterns. A data streaming platform not only facilitates real-time event processing, but also ensures governance, enforces data quality, and connects disparate data sources into a unified stream. \n\nBy processing data close to the source, it reduces latency and enhances decisionmaking, allowing AI agents to operate with the freshest, most relevant data, while maintaining compliance and control across the organization. \n\nEDA transforms AI from isolated models into a dynamic system of agents that react to events in real time. By using a data streaming platform, agents can consume, process, and emit events asynchronously, ensuring scalable, flexible, and resilient interactions. Whether it’s a single agent handling customer queries, or a network of agents optimizing a supply chain, event-driven design ensures they stay in sync, without breaking down under complexity. \n\nThis ebook is a guide to building eventdriven AI agents and multi-agent systems. We’ll cover the evolution of AI, the anatomy of an agent, design patterns for scalable architectures, and real-world applications. At the core of this approach is a data streaming platform, which enables agents to consume, process, and act on real-time data, while maintaining governance and scalability. The goal is simple: to demonstrate why eventdriven design—powered by a data streaming platform—is the backbone of AI’s next evolution, and how to architect systems that are not only effective today, but are built for long-term scalability and adaptability. \n\nPart I: Understanding the Evolution of AI \n\nAI has evolved through three distinct phases, each unlocking new capabilities, while introducing its own limitations. \n\nThe First Wave: Predictive AI \n\nThe first wave of AI revolved around traditional machine learning, focusing on predictive capabilities for narrowly defined tasks. \n\nBuilding these models required significant expertise, as they were crafted specifically for individual use cases. They were domain-specific, with their domain specificity embedded in the training data, making them rigid and tough to repurpose. Adapting a model to a new domain often meant starting from scratch—an approach that lacked scalability and slowed adoption. \n\nThe Second Wave: Generative AI \n\nGenerative AI, driven by deep learning, marked a turning point. \n\nInstead of being confined to single domains, these generative models were trained on vast, diverse datasets, giving them the ability to generalize across a variety of contexts. They could generate text, images, and even videos, opening up exciting new applications. Whereas predictive AI relies on traditional batch-based statistical models to solve specific problems, generative AI uses foundation models like LLMs that are broadly capable and reusable: \n\nHowever, this wave came with its own challenges. \n\nGenerative models are fixed in time—unable to incorporate new or dynamic information— and are difficult to adapt. Fine-tuning can address domain-specific needs, but it’s expensive and error-prone. Fine-tuning requires vast data, significant computational resources, and ML expertise, making it impractical for many situations. Additionally, since LLMs are trained on publicly available data", "full_doc_id": "doc-7777c920c79808444a69426fa44312e8", "file_path": "20250423-EB-Event-Driven_Design_for_Agents_copy.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-649a8550ca25b31b1eac35cf9ef704d5", "__created_at__": 1769914463, "content": "foundation models like LLMs that are broadly capable and reusable: \n\nHowever, this wave came with its own challenges. \n\nGenerative models are fixed in time—unable to incorporate new or dynamic information— and are difficult to adapt. Fine-tuning can address domain-specific needs, but it’s expensive and error-prone. Fine-tuning requires vast data, significant computational resources, and ML expertise, making it impractical for many situations. Additionally, since LLMs are trained on publicly available data, they don’t have access to domain-specific information, limiting their ability to accurately respond to questions that require context. \n\nFor example, suppose you ask a generative model to recommend an insurance policy tailored to a user’s personal health history, location, and financial goals. \n\nIn this scenario, you prompt the LLM and it generates a response. Clearly the model can’t deliver accurate recommendations, because it lacks access to the relevant user data. Without it, the response will either be generic or flat-out wrong. \n\nCompound AI Bridges the Gap \n\nTo overcome these limitations, Compound AI systems integrate generative models with other components like programmatic logic, data retrieval mechanisms, and validation layers. This modular design allows AI to combine tools, fetch relevant data, and tailor outputs in a way that static models cannot. \n\nFor instance, in the insurance recommendation example: \n\nThis process, known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), bridges the gap between static AI and real-world needs by dynamically incorporating relevant data into the model’s workflow. \n\nWhile RAG effectively handles tasks like this, it relies on fixed workflows, meaning every interaction and execution path must be predefined. This rigidity makes it impractical to handle more complex or dynamic tasks, where workflows cannot be exhaustively encoded. Encoding all possible execution paths manually is labor-intensive and ultimately limiting. \n\nThe limitations of fixed-flow architectures have led to the rise of the third wave of AI: agentic systems. \n\nThe Third Wave: Agentic AI \n\nAs HubSpot CTO Dharmesh Shah put it, “Agents are the new apps.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff echoed this sentiment on The Wall Street Journal’s “Future of Everything” podcast, emphasizing that the future of AI lies with autonomous agents—systems that can think, adapt, and act independently. \n\nAgents bring something fundamentally new: dynamic, context-driven workflows. Unlike traditional AI models that follow predefined paths, agentic systems determine the best course of action on the fly, adapting in real time to the challenges they face. This makes them particularly well-suited for solving complex, interconnected problems, in enterprise environments. \n\nAgents flip traditional control logic on its head. \n\nInstead of rigid programs dictating every move, agents use LLMs to drive decisions. They can reason, use tools, and access memory—all dynamically. This flexibility allows for workflows that evolve in real time, making agents far more powerful than anything built on fixed logic. \n\nThe Power of Singular Agent Systems \n\nA single agent can be powerful when designed correctly. Effective AI agents share key characteristics: \n\nHowever, traditional architectures make deploying such agents challenging. \n\nAI systems struggle with data freshness, integration complexity, security, governance, and realtime responsiveness. Many still rely on batch-based processing, leading to decisions made based on stale data, while fragmented data landscapes make it difficult to establish contextualized and trustworthy data. These challenges create a data mess, where agents lack the reliable, realtime inputs needed to make effective decisions. This highlights the need for an event-driven foundation powered by a data streaming platform, where agents can securely react to live events, enforce governance, and integrate data from disparate sources in real time—eliminating bottlenecks, and enabling AI systems to operate with speed, accuracy, and compliance. \n\nBefore we explore why event-driven design is critical, we need to break down the fundamental components of an agent. Understanding the anatomy of an agent provides the foundation for architecting scalable, interoperable AI systems. \n\nPart II: The Case for Event-Driven Agentic Systems \n\nIn artificial intelligence, agents have a long history, from early theoretical considerations by Alan Turing and John McCarthy, to rule-based reasoning agents in the 1960s. These agents were designed to act autonomously within a defined context, but their capabilities were limited by narrow applications and rigid logic. \n\nToday, the emergence of foundation models has transformed what’s possible. \n\nThe Anatomy of an Agent \n\nJust like humans, agents solve problems by combining their senses, memory, reasoning, and ability to act. But before diving into these mechanics, there’s one foundational element that underpins everything: their persona. \n\nPersona (Job Function) \n\nThe persona of an agent defines its job function and expertise. It’s like a detailed job description embedded into the system prompt, shaping the agent’s behavior and responses. The system prompt sets expectations, and influences the model’s probability distribution over tokens, to align outputs with the defined role. \n\nPerception (Sensing) \n\nWith a clear role, the first step to solving any problem is understanding the environment. For agents, perception is their sensory input—how they gather data from the world around them. Humans use eyes, ears, and touch; agents use APIs, sensors, and user inputs. \n\nReasoning and Decision-Making \n\nOnce information is gathered, it needs to be processed and understood. Reasoning is the agent’s ability to analyze data, derive insights, and decide what to do next. For humans, this happens in the brain. For agents, it’s powered by models like LLMs, which dynamically adapt to inputs and contexts. \n\nMemory \n\nMemory allows agents to retain domain-specific information across interactions. It’s not about learning, which is a separate part of the anatomy. Humans rely on both short-term memory (like recalling the start of a conversation) and long-term memory (like remembering a skill learned years ago). Agents work the same way. \n\nShort", "full_doc_id": "doc-7777c920c79808444a69426fa44312e8", "file_path": "20250423-EB-Event-Driven_Design_for_Agents_copy.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-f4b5515bbe441a5d3e8b11a9cb6a085e", "__created_at__": 1769914463, "content": "to do next. For humans, this happens in the brain. For agents, it’s powered by models like LLMs, which dynamically adapt to inputs and contexts. \n\nMemory \n\nMemory allows agents to retain domain-specific information across interactions. It’s not about learning, which is a separate part of the anatomy. Humans rely on both short-term memory (like recalling the start of a conversation) and long-term memory (like remembering a skill learned years ago). Agents work the same way. \n\nShort-term memory allows the agent to keep track of the immediate context within a conversation, which might be stored temporarily in memory buffers during the session. Meanwhile, long-term memory involves storing historical data, such as user preferences or past interactions. This could be a vector database like MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Pinecone, or another permanent storage. A vector database enables semantic search, where embeddings allow the agent to retrieve relevant information efficiently. \n\nPlanning \n\nOnce the agent knows what needs to be done, it devises a plan to achieve its goal. This step mirrors how humans strategize: breaking a problem into smaller steps and prioritizing actions. \n\nAction \n\nPlanning is worthless without execution. Action is where agents interact with the world, whether by sending a message, controlling a device, or updating a database. \n\nThe agent’s execution handlers are responsible for ensuring these actions are performed accurately, and for validating the outcomes. \n\nLearning \n\nHumans improve by learning from mistakes and adapting to new information. Agents do the same, using machine learning to refine their reasoning, improve predictions, and optimize actions. \n\nThis process may involve adjusting the agent’s context dynamically during prompt assembly, allowing it to refine its responses based on situational feedback, without making permanent changes to the model’s weights. Alternatively, learning can also occur through reinforcement \n\nlearning, where decision-making is optimized using rewards or penalties tied to specific actions. In many cases, adapting context provides a flexible and efficient way for agents to improve, without the overhead of fine-tuning. \n\nCoordination and Collaboration \n\nHumans rarely work alone—we collaborate, share knowledge, and divide tasks. In multi-agent systems, coordination enables agents to do the same, working together to achieve shared goals. \n\nTool Interface \n\nHumans use tools to amplify their capabilities—doctors use stethoscopes, and programmers use integrated development environments (IDEs). Agents are no different. The tool interface is their bridge to specialized capabilities, allowing them to extend their reach, and operate effectively in the real world. \n\nThese interfaces often rely on modular API handlers or plugin architectures, allowing the agent to extend its functionality dynamically and efficiently. Agents sense their environment, process inputs, recall relevant information, make decisions, and take action. These steps mirror human cognition and problem-solving, but operate within digital ecosystems. \n\nWhy Event-Driven Matters for Agents \n\nAgents, at their core, function much like microservices—as modular, independent units that execute specific tasks. However, unlike traditional microservices, agents don’t just process requests; they reason, plan, and take actions based on stateful information. Without proper coordination, this complexity can quickly spiral out of control. \n\nImagine deploying hundreds of microservices without guardrails—without standardized communication, state synchronization, or failure recovery mechanisms. The result would be chaos. The same applies to multi-agent systems: without a structured framework, agents become fragmented, inefficient, and unreliable. \n\nMicroservices architecture evolved to solve similar challenges by shifting from tightly coupled, request/response-based communication to event-driven design. \n\nEarly monolithic applications struggled to scale, because every component had direct dependencies on others. Microservices addressed this by decoupling services, allowing them to operate independently. But managing interservice communication through APIs still introduced bottlenecks. The breakthrough came with event-driven architectures (EDA), where services could react to changes asynchronously, enabling real-time responsiveness and scalability. \n\nAgents need the same shift. \n\nInstead of rigid, API-driven interactions, they should operate in an event-driven ecosystem, consuming and emitting events dynamically. EDA provides the necessary foundation for scalable, adaptive agents by ensuring: \n\nBy borrowing from microservices architecture, event-driven agentic systems enable flexibility, resilience, and efficiency at scale. Just as microservices rely on message brokers like Apache Kafka® for asynchronous communication, agents leverage event streaming to collaborate without rigid dependencies. A data streaming platform takes this further by not just streaming data, but also connecting disparate data sources, processing events in motion, and enforcing governance. \n\nWith a data streaming platform, agents operate on real-time, contextualized data, avoiding stale insights from batch processing. It enables dynamic filtering, transformation, and secure data sharing, ensuring decisions are made with the freshest, most relevant information. This keeps agent ecosystems adaptive, scalable, and ready for real-world challenges—moving beyond static, request-driven workflows, to truly autonomous AI systems. \n\nFrom Singular to Multi-Agent Systems \n\nAs powerful as a single agent can be, its capabilities are inherently limited by its scope. \n\nNo single agent can handle every possible task with full expertise, just as no individual worker in a company can effectively perform every job. The real promise of agentic AI lies in multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple specialized agents work together, coordinating actions, exchanging information, and dynamically adapting to changes. \n\nA MAS is a network of agents that collaborate (or sometimes compete) to solve complex problems more effectively than any single agent could on its own. These systems are designed to distribute workloads, balance specialization, and enable decentralized decision-making. \n\nMulti-agent systems allow: \n\nTo function effectively, multi-agent systems require seamless coordination and communication. Traditional API-based integrations create tight coupling, where agents must know exactly which other agents to interact with. This approach does not scale. As the number of agents grows, the complexity of interactions increases exponentially. \n\nEvent-driven architecture ensures seamless coordination, enabling agents to operate as part of an adaptive, resilient ecosystem.

In the next section, we’ll explore the design patterns that make multiagent interactions scalable and efficient. \n\nPart III: Design Patterns for Multi-Agent Systems \n\nEnterprises require networks of agents that collaborate, share context, and execute workflows together. However, scaling from a single agent to a multi-agent system introduces significant challenges: \n\nConfluent Data Streaming Platform is the future-proof foundation for addressing these challenges. It acts as the communication layer and data enabler in the agentic AI stack: \n\nCONFLUENT \n\nEnd-to-End Agents with ConfluentData Streaming Platform \n\nCloud Platforms \n\nBy combining four key pillars—Stream, Connect, Process, and Govern—Confluent enables agents to seamlessly consume, process, and act on data in motion. \n\nThis section explores key design patterns that enable multi-agent systems to function as scalable, resilient, and adaptable networks, leveraging a data streaming platform to unlock real-time AI capabilities without infrastructure headaches. \n\nMulti-Agent Design Patterns \n\nMulti-agent design patterns define how autonomous agents communicate, collaborate, or compete to solve problems. These patterns structure interactions between agents, ensuring efficient decision-making and workload distribution. \n\nBelow, we examine four essential patterns: Orchestrator-Worker, Hierarchical Agent, Blackboard, and Market-Based, along with how event-driven architectures transform them into scalable, loosely coupled systems. A data streaming platform not only enables any multi-agent system design pattern, but goes far beyond just Apache Kafka®, providing all the tools to connect and unlock data from any system, enforce governance for quality and compliance, and process data into high-value streams that fuel real-time, intelligent agent decision-making. \n\nOrchestrator-Worker Pattern \n\nIn the Orchestrator-Worker pattern, a central agent assigns tasks to worker agents and manages execution. This is akin to the Master-Worker pattern in distributed computing, where an orchestrator coordinates multiple independent workers that execute specific jobs. \n\nTraditional Approach: \n\nEvent-Driven Approach: \n\nUsing data streaming, we can adapt this pattern to make the agents event-driven. Confluent Data Streaming Platform offers key-based Kafka partitioning strategies, so the orchestrator can use keys to distribute command messages across partitions in a single topic. Worker agents can then act as a consumer group, pulling events from one or more assigned partitions to complete the work. Each worker agent then sends output messages into a second topic, where it can be consumed by downstream systems. \n\nThe pattern now looks like this: \n\nWhile this diagram looks more complex, it dramatically simplifies the operations of the system. \n\nThe orchestrator no longer has to manage its connections to worker agents, including managing what happens if one dies, or handling more or fewer worker agents. Instead, it uses a keying strategy that distributes work across partitions. For events that should be processed by the stateful worker agent as some previous message, the same key can be used for each event in a sequence. The worker agents gain the benefits of any consumer group. \n\nThe worker agents pull from one or more partitions, and the Kafka Consumer Rebalance Protocol assures that each worker has similar workloads, even as worker agents are added or removed. In the event of a worker failure, the log can be replayed from a given partition for a saved offset. The orchestrator no longer needs bespoke logic for managing workers; instead, it simply specifies work and distributes it with a sensible keying strategy. Similarly, the worker agents inherit the functionality of a Kafka consumer group, so they can use common machinery for coordination, scaling, and fault recovery. \n\nThis pattern allows for dynamic scaling, automatic fault recovery, and efficient workload distribution without the need for complex management logic. \n\nHierarchical Agent Pattern \n\nThe Hierarchical Agent pattern organizes agents into layers, where higher-level agents oversee or delegate tasks to lower-level agents. This is ideal for breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. \n\nTraditional Approach: \n\nEvent-Driven Approach: \n\nTo make the hierarchical pattern event-driven, we apply the same techniques for decomposing work in the orchestrator-worker pattern recursively in the agent hierarchy, such that each nonleaf node is the orchestrator for its respective subtree. \n\nBy making hierarchical coordination event-driven, agents publish and subscribe to event streams, rather than rely on direct supervision: \n\nWith this approach, hierarchy is no longer rigid, agents can be added or removed dynamically without modifying the system’s core logic. Asynchronous event processing ensures scalability while maintaining structured delegation. \n\nBlackboard Pattern \n\nThe Blackboard Pattern introduces a shared knowledge base—a “blackboard”—where agents asynchronously post and retrieve information.

Apache Flink® with AI Model Inference is used to orchestrate communication with a series of AI agents. \n\nThe system consists of the following agents: \n\nVisit this GitHub repo to learn more. \n\nThe Role of the Data Streaming Platform in Multi-Agent Systems \n\nFor multi-agent systems to function efficiently, they must operate under a shared event-driven model that standardizes communication and decision-making. This model consists of three primary components: \n\nBy following this event-driven framework, multi-agent systems gain modularity, resilience, and the ability to scale dynamically. \n\nMaintaining state consistency across multiple agents requires event persistence and replayability. This is where immutable logs and event sourcing come into play. \n\nThis model dramatically improves reliability, making it easier to debug failures, scale workloads, and maintain real-time synchronization. \n\nAs multi-agent architectures become more prevalent, event-driven patterns are essential to ensuring they remain scalable, adaptable, and efficient. \n\nBy applying the lessons from microservices architecture, AI agents can be designed to operate in a loosely coupled, decentralized manner, reacting to events rather than relying on rigid dependencies. This enables the creation of AI-driven ecosystems where agents collaborate seamlessly across complex workflows, unlocking new possibilities for enterprise automation and large-scale AI systems. \n\nIn the next section, we’ll explore how to build and deploy these event-driven agents in real-world applications, leveraging a data streaming platform with fully managed Kafka and Flink for scalable execution. \n\nPart IV: Building Event-Driven Systems for Agents with a Data Streaming Platform \n\nAI agents are only as effective as the infrastructure that supports them. No matter how sophisticated an agent’s reasoning and decision-making capabilities are, they depend on access to the right data, tools, and communication channels. Traditional architectures—built around request/response patterns, rigid APIs, and batch data processing—create bottlenecks that limit an agent’s ability to act in real time. \n\nEDAs solve this by treating data as a continuously moving asset, rather than a static snapshot. By using Confluent Data Streaming Platform as the backbone, agents can consume, process, and emit events asynchronously, making them adaptable, scalable, and resilient for enterprise use cases. \n\nIn this section, we’ll explore how to architect enterprise-ready event-driven AI systems, tackle the challenges of real-time agent interaction, and apply these concepts to real-world applications. \n\nArchitecting Singular and Multi-Agent Systems \n\nThe shift to event-driven architectures marks a pivotal moment in building scalable agent systems. Instead of waiting for direct instructions, agents are designed to emit and listen for events autonomously. Events act as signals that something has happened—a change in data, a triggered action, or an important update—allowing agents to respond dynamically and independently. \n\nAt their core, AI agents function much like microservices, operating autonomously but needing structured communication to collaborate effectively. Confluent Data Streaming Platform acts as the “central nervous system” for agents, enabling them to function in a loosely coupled, but highly coordinated manner. \n\nStream \n\nContinuously capture and share real-time events with AI systems and agents anywhere, built on Kora, the cloudnative Apache Kafka® engine. \n\nConnect \n\nIntegrate disparate data from any environment, with $^ { 1 2 0 + }$ pre-built and custom connectors, bringing real-time data to agents. \n\nProcess \n\nUse Flink stream processing (e.g., join, filter) to enrich data with real-time context at query execution, enabling agentic RAG. \n\nGovern \n\nUse data lineage, quality controls, and traceability to ensure data for agents is secure and verifiable. \n\nThe Central Nervous System for Agentic Systems \n\nBy integrating Apache Kafka®, Apache Flink®, and an existing agent framework like LangGraph, we can build architectures that scale horizontally, process high-throughput data streams, and ensure real-time responsiveness. \n\nHere’s what Confluent Data Streaming Platform provides: \n\nA tightly integrated, event-driven pipeline ensures that agents not only receive fresh data, but also act on it dynamically, making real-time AI applications possible. \n\nChallenges and Solutions in Event-Driven Agent Design \n\nWhile the benefits of an event-driven approach are clear, building AI-powered agentic systems comes with its own set of challenges. Below, we address key roadblocks and how Confluent Data Streaming Platform provides solutions. \n\nStream Next-Level Data Streaming with a Fully Managed, Cloud-Native Service \n\nIn an agent-driven system, failures, whether from network issues, hardware faults, or software crashes, are inevitable. The challenge is ensuring agents can recover seamlessly without disrupting workflows. \n\nSolution: \n\nConnect Seamless Integration: Connecting Agents with Diverse Systems \n\nAI agents often interact with multiple external systems, such as databases, APIs, vector stores, and enterprise applications.

Below are a few examples of how companies are using a data streaming platform to build event-driven multi-agent systems. \n\n1. Automating Web Scraping with AI Agents \n\nTraditional web scraping is brittle, requiring manual efforts to handle dynamic pages, extract relevant data, and adapt to site changes. This complexity increases when supporting GenAI models, which need structured and unstructured data in real time. Static scraping workflows fail to keep up, leading to outdated or incomplete information. \n\nReworkd tackled this problem by building an agentic system for web scraping. AI agents write code to extract relevant data, while test and validation agents verify that the generated code is correct. These agents operate asynchronously, consuming and producing events in a continuous feedback loop. \n\nThe agents seamlessly process and stream real-time data into downstream applications. The result: a scalable, fault-tolerant system that dynamically adjusts to website changes, and ensures high-quality data feeds for AI models. \n\n2. Intelligent Business Copilots \n\nTeams need self-serve, real-time access to data for faster, smarter decision-making. Yet, business stakeholders often rely on engineering and data science teams to integrate and query data, introducing bottlenecks, batch-based delays, and stale insights. \n\nAiry transforms this process by enabling AI-powered copilots that provide a natural language interface for exploring and working with real-time data. Agents convert plain language into Flink jobs, continuously monitoring and processing data streams. \n\nBy leveraging real-time context from a data streaming platform, these agents use LLMs to generate precise Flink SQL queries, empowering teams to extract and analyze live data instantly. This shifts data interaction from manual queries to conversational, real-time insights, making knowledge more accessible than ever. \n\n3. Workflow Automation with a Drag-and-Drop Agent Builder \n\nWhen starting to build multi-agent systems, teams face the complexity of integrating and orchestrating AI agents and tools, as well as managing intricate tasks at scale. \n\nAgent Taskflow provides a no-code platform that helps users get up and running with all the features that go into an agent–memory, knowledge bases, and tools–in just a few clicks. The drag-and-drop UI allows for effortless creation of workflows. \n\nBuilt on a data streaming platform, the solution enables agents to make context-informed decisions and adapt to real-time events, for more efficient and intelligent automation. From automating customer support to marketing campaigns, this frees teams to focus on high-value work while democratizing AI agents, making it accessible to users without programming expertise. \n\nBroader Industry Impact \n\nEvent-driven AI agents enable businesses to automate complex, real-time tasks across industries: \n\nBy adopting event-driven multi-agent systems, businesses gain resilient, adaptive AI workflows that evolve dynamically. As this paradigm becomes standard, companies that integrate streaming-first architectures will gain a competitive edge in automating complex, data-intensive processes. \n\nWhy a Data Streaming Platform is Essential for AI Agents \n\nAt the heart of every scalable agentic system is a real-time data streaming platform. Unlike traditional request/response architectures that introduce bottlenecks and stale data, streaming enables continuous, low-latency access to the information agents need. \n\nWhy streaming matters: \n\nBy adopting a shift-left approach—moving computation closer to the data source—organizations can reduce latency, improve AI performance, and create a more adaptive architecture. \n\nThe Future of AI is Event-Driven \n\nAI-powered agents will define the next era of automation, but only if they can think, act, and collaborate in real time. Event-driven architectures ensure that agents are no longer limited by outdated batch processes, rigid APIs, or stale data. Instead, they operate dynamically— processing, analyzing, and acting on real-time events as they happen. \n\nAs AI adoption accelerates, companies that embrace streaming-first architectures will have a massive advantage. They’ll build AI systems that are smarter, more adaptable, and infinitely scalable, unlocking true agentic intelligence across industries. \n\nTake the Next Step \n\nTo get started with building event-driven multi-agents: \n\nAbout Confluent \n\nConfluent is pioneering a fundamentally new category of data infrastructure focused on data in motion.
